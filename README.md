# Systems-Analysis-and-

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    The client, DriverPass, wanted to help learning drivers pass their driving tests. To do this they wanted us to create a system that allows their customers to use a profile to make appointments for in-person driving practice with a coach and view driving learning materials online.

What did you do particularly well?
    I feel like I was able to create diagrams highlighting different aspects of the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    One thing I oould expand on is the class diagram. I feel like there are a lot more classes and relationships between them than I initially put in my diagram.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I felt I interpreted them well. It is the most important because the users is the one "using" the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
